# OS-Project

This is an operating systems project which is a simulation to a real OS.\
\
##Phase 1:\
Implmenting scheduler algorithms (SRTN, RR, HPF)\
\
##Phase 2:\
Manage the memory allocation using buddy system algorithm.\
\
##Phase 3:\
Synchonrize with semaphores and shared memory.\
\
The program needs an input file that has the processes to run.\
You can run test_generator.c to produce random test cases for and start running.\
